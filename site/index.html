            <h1>Welcome to Juan's Website</h1>
            <p>I am an international student from Indonesia, ever since I was a kid I always have a fascination in
                computing especially
                in the technical side of things, I've always wanted to attend programming course after graduation but
                instead I went for
                Accounting major just because. So, I want to use this chance to learn programming in depth in this
                course and land a career
                in computing.<br>
                <br>
                Aside from that, at my free time I usually play video games or read books. My all-time favorite game
                would be Dota 2 since I
                have played that game since I was a kid and it kept me engrossed even after 10 years. For singleplayer
                game, my favorite is
                Elden Ring, I have always been a big fan of Souls series and Elden Ring is the perfect form of all souls
                game combined.
                The world is vast, beautiful and packed with contents, not to mention the strongest point of souls
                series, the combat.
                The combat feels fluid, fast paced and challenging.
